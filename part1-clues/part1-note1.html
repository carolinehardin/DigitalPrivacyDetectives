        You found a sticky note with a reminder on it!<br><br> 
        It reads: "Don't forget your report on digital privacy! Remember to make stronger passwords and change account settings!"<br><br> 
        Oh this must be referring to the photo that got out! Probably a good idea for Sam to update all account information and settings!<br><br>
        Maybe it would be a good idea for you to double check that too!<br><br>
        I wonder where that report could be?<br><br><br>
