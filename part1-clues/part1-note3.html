        You found another sticky note with a reminder on it!<br><br> 
        It reads: "Reminder: Delete photos of me and Jordan or tuck them away in a locked folder"<br><br> 
        Do you think the leaked photo could've been a personal photo between Sam and Jordan? Do you think it's a good idea for Sam to delete them?<br><br><br>
