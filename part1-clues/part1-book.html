        This looks like a letter from Jordan to Sam!<br><br> 
        It mentions Jordan not being able to get over Sam! And all of their memories together. Looks like they shared a lot together. Do you think the photos Jordan talked about could be the same photos that were leaked of Sam?<br><br> 
        I wonder how Jordan reacted to all of this!<br><br><br>
