            Digital Clue Room | Part 1<br><br>
            Detective! On your way to school, Sam texts you asking you to stop by her place to look for her missing report!<br><br>
            While you're there, you realize you don't really know where anything is!<br><br>
            See if you can help Sam by looking around the room! Good luck!<br><br><br>

            Good Job Detective!<br><br>
            You are done with this digital clue room! Looks like maybe Sam's report is somewhere else?<br><br>
            Oh well! Maybe you'll come across it at some point later.<br><br>
            Hopefully she doesn't need it first period!<br><br><br>

        Don't forget your report on digital privacy! Remember to make stronger passwords and change account settings!

    <div class="note1-message" hidden>
        You found a sticky note with a reminder on it!<br><br> 
        It reads: "Don't forget your report on digital privacy! Remember to make stronger passwords and change account settings!"<br><br> 
        Oh this must be referring to the photo that got out! Probably a good idea for Sam to update all account information and settings!<br><br>
        Maybe it would be a good idea for you to double check that too!<br><br>
        I wonder where that report could be?<br><br><br>

        Looks like you found a Valentine's day note!<br><br> 
        It reads: "Jordan + Sam 4Ever...There is no one like you...Jordan  ♡...2.14"<br><br>
        Wow. Sam and Jordan looked like they were really in love!<br><br> 
        I wonder how hard it will be for Jordan to get over Sam? Poor Jordan must be heartbroken...<br><br><br>

        You found another sticky note with a reminder on it!<br><br> 
        It reads: "Reminder: Delete photos of me and Jordan or tuck them away in a locked folder"<br><br> 
        Do you think the leaked photo could've been a personal photo between Sam and Jordan? Do you think it's a good idea for Sam to delete them?<br><br><br>

        Hmm just looks like some blank note cards...<br><br> 
        These could come in handy for a test!<br><br>
        Doesn't really look Sam's report though. <br><br> 
        Pretty interesting idea for a report! Maybe it would be worthwhile to read about Digital Privacy!<br><br><br>

        What's this?<br><br> 
        It looks like papers tucked in between the books!<br><br> 
        Hmmm this doesnt look like Sam's report...it looks pretty private...do you still want to read it?<br><br><br>
        <a class="accept papers-yes">Yes</a>
        <a class="button papers-no">No</a>
    </div>

    <div class="papers-message" hidden>
        This looks like a letter from Jordan to Sam!<br><br> 
        It mentions Jordan not being able to get over Sam! And all of their memories together. Looks like they shared a lot together. Do you think the photos Jordan talked about could be the same photos that were leaked of Sam?<br><br> 
        I wonder how Jordan reacted to all of this!<br><br><br>
