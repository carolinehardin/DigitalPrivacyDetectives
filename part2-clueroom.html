            Digital Clue Room | Part 2<br><br>
            Hmmm looks like the report wasn't in Sam's room!<br><br>
            You head to school and find that you have some time before class to walk around the halls.<br><br>
            There seems to be a lot of trash all over the place! Maybe try helping out the custodian and picking some up!<br><br><br>

            Good Job Detective!<br><br>
            You are done with this digital clue room! Great job finding Sam's report!<br><br>
            Better tell Sam you got it and head over to class!<br><br>
            You don't want to be late for study hall!<br><br><br>

        Woah! Wait a second! It's Sam's report!<br><br>
        I guess Sam didn't forget it at home! But instead dropped it heading to class!<br><br>
        Hmm that's weird . . . do you notice anything off about Sam's report?<br><br>
        This must be a first draft! I don't think Sam would turn in this copy. Maybe it would be good to check in and see how Sam is doing?<br><br>
