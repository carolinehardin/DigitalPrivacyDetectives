        Woah! Wait a second! It's Sam's report!<br><br>
        I guess Sam didn't forget it at home! But instead dropped it heading to class!<br><br>
        Hmm that's weird . . . do you notice anything off about Sam's report?<br><br>
        This must be a first draft! I don't think Sam would turn in this copy. Maybe it would be good to check in and see how Sam is doing?<br><br>
