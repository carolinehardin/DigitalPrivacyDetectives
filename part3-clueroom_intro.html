            Digital Clue Room | Part 3<br><br>
            Right as you are about to pack up and head out of study hall, you get an email from an anonymous source!<br><br>
            Is it from the same person asking you to go to the food court?<br><br>
            I wonder what it could say!<br><br><br>
            <a class="button start-2">Start</a>
        </div>
        <div class="jumbotron notify-message" hidden>
            Maybe there's a way to find out who this message is from!
            Have you noticed anyone acting a little weird lately?<br><br>
            Try checking what it says for clues!<br><br><br>
