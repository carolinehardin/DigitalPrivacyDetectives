 Before the event

     1. Print all signs

     2. Print or write out notes.

       a. Printing is faster, but writing them out will give a more authentic feel.
       b. Use different paper or ink colors for notes to add interest
       c. Always use all the `important’ notes. You can choose as many as you like from the other notes, for one to three per station. Put some at the start to give kids waiting for a turn something to do.

    3. Gather station props

    4. Get five laptops (1 for each station plus a back up)

    5. Put HTML files on a flash drive

    6. Collect prizes if doing raffle at end

    Prop suggestions
      The props set the mood, and add an ‘escape room’ element. The notes should be hidden around the props - some easy to find for the little kids, and some cleverly for the older kids. Ripping up a note and putting it at multiple stations can add an interesting challenge! The stations are designed to be easy to set up with inexpensive, everyday objects. Most can be found around the house or with a stop at a coffee shop or fast food restaurant. Below are some suggested items for each station.

      1. Sam’s room (remember the player picks Sam’s gender so keep it plausibly a boy/girl/other room)
         a. Youth literature
         b. Candy packages
         c. Stuffy
         d. Socks

    Running the station instructions

       1. Verbally invite kids to play if there isn’t a line:
         a. “Do you want to play a detective game? An embarrassing photo was emailed to the whole school, and you need to figure out who sent it, and why. You’ll do a choose-your-own-adventure story game, and try to solve the clues in the room. It takes about 20 minutes to play. There’s a prize at the end!”

       2. Get kids started!
         a. Give a note sheet and pen - note sheet has character’s names on it, and can be the raffle ticket
         b. Have them look through notes at station 0 and take notes while they wait to start
         c. They can pick up, look through, and interact with anything at the station.
         d. Ask them to re-hide clue notes when they are done with them

       3. Keeping the flow going
         a. They have about 5 minutes at each station (if there’s people behind them) otherwise they can take their time
         b. After they are done with a station, check quick on the laptop that they are back at the start (there’s a quick button to get back to start)
         c. Re -hide any clues
         d. If one station is becoming a bottleneck, reduce the number of clues and/or props there to a station that’s going faster

       4. When they are done
         a. Ask them to write their best digital privacy tip on a post it note and add it to the wall
         b. Encourage them to take a selfie at the wall of tips
         c. Ask them:
              i.   Who did it? (Becky)
              ii.  Why? (Becky has a crush on Jordan, and thinks that if she sends the photo out then Jordan will get over Sam faster)
              iii. What could have prevented this from happening? (Respecting each other’s privacy, not forwarding the photo, supporting Sam)

       5. Closing
          a. Please send a picture of each of your stations, and the selfie wall to Carolinedhardin@gmail.com
