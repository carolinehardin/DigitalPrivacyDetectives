            Digital Clue Room | Part 3<br><br>
            Right as you are about to pack up and head out of study hall, you get an email from an anonymous source!<br><br>
            Is it from the same person asking you to go to the food court?<br><br>
            I wonder what it could say!<br><br><br>
            <a class="button start-2">Start</a>
        </div>
        <div class="jumbotron notify-message" hidden>
            Maybe there's a way to find out who this message is from!
            Have you noticed anyone acting a little weird lately?<br><br>
            Try checking what it says for clues!<br><br><br>
            <a class="button notify-next">Next</a>

            Good Job Detective!<br><br>
            You are done with this digital clue room! Did you find anything interesting?<br><br>
            Did you ever find out who sent you that email? Is it a different anonymous than before?<br><br>
            Things are starting to get really interesting!<br><br><br>

                    hey theRe little detective,<br><br>
                    loOks like you seem To know a lot of what's going on...at 1east on the surface.<br>
                    how much do you r3Ally know about the people around you, though?<br>
                    sometimes people you know could be seNding clues and you might not even know it! a little puzzle for the mind, social cues if you will. sometimes a typo can mean so much more. was it intentional? or a slip of the thumb?<br><br>
                    that's for you to decipher.<br><br>
                    the. next time you look throuGh your emails, take a few<br>
                    moments. to sEe if you can find exactly what<br>
                    they. meant or even maybe to see what it is the senders have<br>
                    shared. with you.<br><br>
                    things are not aLways what they seem. but maybe you can be the one to figure it out.<br><br>
                    clues can be presented to you in many different ways. i'll let you in on a little secret. here are some ways i have been aBle to pick up on clues myself:<br><br>
                    - capItal or lowercase letters in weird places<br>
                    - punctuation that doesn't make any sense<br>
                    - typos<br>
                    - woRds that don't seem as if they belong<br><br>
                    try to keep in mind the people you are talking to anD their stories...<br>
                    there might be connections between people you may not even realize.<br><br>
                    good luck,<br>
                    ace<br><br>
                    P.S. sometimes clues can be words scrambled in a combination of the ways mentioned above.
